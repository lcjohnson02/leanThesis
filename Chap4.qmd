$$
[x]_R = \{y \in A \mid yRx\}.
$$
The set whose elements are all of these equivalence classes is called $A$ *mod* $R$.  It is written $A/R$, so
$$
A/R = \{[x]_R \mid x \in A\}.
$$
Note that $A/R$ is a set whose elements are sets: for each $x \in A$, $[x]_R$ is a subset of $A$, and $[x]_R \in A/R$.
