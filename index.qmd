Hello World


## Making Chapters

I am using this section to figure out how to incorporate a table of contents and different sections/chapters of the paper. This should prove useful in the final thesis and allow readers to quickly jump to important or interesting sections. 


## Incorporating Some Code


I will also be able to use some LaTeX equations within the document which could halp to make the paper look quite nice. 

If $a < b$ and $c \le d$, prove that $a + c \le b + d$.
It just so happens that I was able to prove this using lean!

```{}
example (a b c d : ℝ) (h1: a < b) (h2 : c ≤ d) : a + c < b + d := by
  by_cases h3 : c = d
  rw [h3]
  apply add_lt_add_right h1
  push_neg at h3
  have h4 : c < d := by
    apply Ne.lt_of_le h3 h2
  apply add_lt_add h1 h4
  done
```

Now to display the benefits of the lean infoview!

## Showing the Infoview with Picture Sequences

Not going to do this now as I think the columns are far superior.

## Showing Infoview with Columns



As we can clearly see, this is the first step of the code and it can now be explained with great ease. Now onto the next step!

::: {.inpt}
```lean
theorem Example_3_2_4_v2 (P Q R : Prop)
    (h : P → (Q → R)) : ¬R → (P → ¬Q) := by
  assume h2 : ¬R
  assume h3 : P
  **done::

```state
